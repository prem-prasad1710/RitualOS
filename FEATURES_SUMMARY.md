## 🎓 For Interviews

### Key Talking Points:

**"How is this different from existing apps?"**
> "It solves the full user journey. Most apps are either meditation (Calm), habits (Habitica), or timers (Forest). RitualOS does crisis intervention (Quick Rituals), learning (AI Coach), discovery (Marketplace), and motivation (Challenges) in one platform."

**"What makes the Quick Rituals special?"**
> "When you're having a panic attack, you can't spend 5 minutes building a ritual. Quick Rituals give you one-tap access to emergency relief. It's the difference between a tool and a lifeline."

**"Why community marketplace?"**
> "Social proof. People trust what works for others. The marketplace removes the trial-and-error phase and lets users start with proven rituals immediately."

**"How do challenges increase retention?"**
> "They create structured commitment without guilt. Each challenge has a clear goal, psychological reasoning, and reward. It's motivation through purpose, not punishment."
