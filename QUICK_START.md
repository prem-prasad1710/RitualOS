## 💡 Interview Talking Points

**"Why did you build this?"**
"I noticed Gen Z struggles with digital overwhelm and anxiety. Most productivity tools are task-focused, but I wanted to create something state-focused—that meets you where you are emotionally and guides you to a better state."

**"What was the biggest challenge?"**
"Designing the ritual player experience. It needed to be immersive but not overwhelming, guide without being prescriptive, and feel calming while tracking progress."

**"What makes this unique?"**
"It's not a habit tracker or meditation app. It's a new category—a ritual operating system. Just like an OS manages processes on your computer, RitualOS manages mental processes. Each loop is a program that transforms your state."

**"How would you scale this?"**
"Add browser extension to trigger rituals when opening social media, build social accountability features, create a ritual marketplace where users share loops, integrate with wearables for automatic tracking."
